# Architecture

Status: accepted V0 direction; the initial backend Phase 0 foundation is present.

## Current direction

TailTag is a monorepo for the community-led rebuild of a social convention game. The V0 backend direction is:

- Python
- Django and Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL as the primary application database
- Clerk as the player authentication authority
- A TailTag-owned internal application user identity for domain relationships, separate from Clerk
- A modular monolith backend
- Railway for V0 backend hosting

The historical Django POC has been promoted and reset at `services/api/`. Its POC-only authentication, session/CSRF behavior, fursuit fields, routes, deletion behavior, and other experimental choices were evaluation evidence, not V0 requirements.

## Backend phases

Phase 0 begins with the clean `services/api` foundation and will establish the local contributor environment. Phase 1 will establish CI/CD and the shared Railway development environment. This document does not describe final developer commands, environment variables, deployment configuration, or product application behavior.

## Architectural constraints

- Keep the system understandable to a mixed-experience contributor community.
- Keep business and domain rules server-controlled.
- Prefer the simplest deployable shape that satisfies approved product requirements.
- Treat security, privacy, accessibility, and operational recovery as design inputs.
- Use a modular monolith for V0; do not introduce microservices without an approved need.
- Design stable interfaces around product behavior. Add boundaries only where behavior, ownership, deployment, or data responsibility genuinely differs.

## Current repository and open decisions

The repository currently contains documentation, repository checks, and the minimal API foundation. Before adding client applications, shared packages, gameplay capabilities, or other runtime areas, an approved spec and any necessary ADR should establish:

1. the user-visible behavior and trust boundaries;
2. data ownership, retention, and privacy requirements;
3. deployment and operational constraints;
4. interface and failure behavior;
5. verification strategy and rollback path.

Accepted backend choices do not settle every V0/V1 detail. Open decisions include the final domain model, API contracts, client architecture, Clerk integration boundary details, deployment configuration, environment variables, and operational policies. These must be resolved by current approved issues/specs before implementation.

## Verification architecture

`scripts/doctor.sh` validates the local Git/GitHub setup, repository location, remote, branch, working-tree state, required backend/devcontainer artifacts, and host Docker/Compose readiness. Inside the TailTag devcontainer it additionally checks the selected Python version, `uv`, locked dependencies, canonical Make commands, and non-mutating PostgreSQL connectivity. The API workflow (`.github/workflows/api.yml`) runs the locked Python 3.13 environment against PostgreSQL 17 and checks Ruff formatting and linting, strict mypy, pytest, Django checks, migration drift, drf-spectacular configuration validation, and Gunicorn configuration loading. The same commands are documented in `services/api/README.md`.

The API service uses PostgreSQL for runtime checks and does not provide a SQLite fallback. Keep its CI, Docker, and contributor commands aligned as the foundation evolves; do not infer deployment behavior from this local/CI foundation.
